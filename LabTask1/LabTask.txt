Use a terminal session to:

  1. Make a directory called LabTask1 off your home directory. Do the following questions in the directory.
    - Find out your:
        User ID (the number)
        Primary group ID (the number)
        The names of all groups you belong to
        The absolute path of the tcsh shell
        The absolute path of your home directory
        Your PATH environment variable
      Put the answers into a text file named MyStuff.txt. (0.5%)

    - Write a shell script called GetMyStuff.sh that will provide the above information (the script must be a executable, and must work regardless of which directory it is in). Also, just saying cat MyStuff.txt is not sufficient. (0.5%)

    - Read the man pages about the ls and wc commands. Devise a minimal pipeline command that will print the number of files and subdirectories in the current directory (including hidden ones, but not the current and parent directory entries). Put the answer into a text file named MyPipe.txt. (0.5%)

  2. Describe the difference between wc `grep -l int *` and wc * | grep -l int. Why is it not giving the same output? Put the answer into a text file named Explanation.txt.(0.5%)

  3. Consider that you want to rename all files of a given type (e.g. file extension) to a different filetype. For example, you want to change the file extensi on of all txt files to text. Write a shell script rename.sh that:
    - takes two options as arguments. The first argument is the filetype you want to change. The second argument is the filetype you want to change files into.
    - check that the two arguments are actually given. If not, the script is supposed to return a error message and terminate (0.5%).
    - In the next step the script needs to find the corresponding filenames. Each file that is considered needs to be checked if it is a file and has read and write permissions (0.5%).
    - Once files are found their file extensions need to change: For example, file.txt needs to change to file.text. HINT: check the man page of the command sed (0.5%).
    - Finally, the script needs to output something to the effect of notifying the user that file.txt has been changed to file.text (0.5%).

  4. Check out the command df that tells you how much disc space is avaliable on all the mounted devices. Write a shell script disk.sh
    - that finds the line that corresponds to sda1 (HINT: read the man page of grep) (0.5%),
    - extracts the percentage (HINT: check out awk and cut (0.5%),
    - and returns a message if it exceeds a number that was given as an option. Check initially that the option exists (0.5%).
