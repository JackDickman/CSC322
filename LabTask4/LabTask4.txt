Tax time! Let's assume that we have a much simpler tax code (than the IRS currently has), so that we can calculate taxes easily:

  - The tax payer is repeatedly prompted to enter either an amount of income (a positive value) or an amount of deduction (a negative value). This continues until a zero value is entered. The positive values are summed to form the income, and the negative values are summed to form the deduction.
  - The taxable income is computed as the income less the deduction, except in the case that the deduction is greater than than the income in which case the taxable income is zero.
  - A tax group is calculated from the taxable income:
      - Greater or equal to $500000 = Super rich
      - Greater or equal to $200000 = Quite rich
      - Greater or equal to $100000 = Miami poor
      - Greater or equal to $50000 = Average
      - Greater or equal to $20000 = Realistic
      - Less than $20000 = Poor
    The tax group is saved as an uppercase letter, one of S, Q, M, A, R, P.
  - The tax is computed using one of three rates:
      - The super rich and quite rich get taxed at the high rate of 25%.
      - The Miami poor get taxed at the medium rate of 10%.
      - The average and realistic get taxed at the low rate of 3%.
      - The poor pay no tax.
    Additionally, the maximal tax is $50000.
  - The tax information is displayed.

Here is what a sample run should look like (with the keyboard input shown in italics) ...
Enter next amount : 125000
Enter next amount : -250
Enter next amount : -3000
Enter next amount : 15000
Enter next amount : 88000
Enter next amount : -200
Enter next amount : 0

Income         = $228000.00
Deductions     = $  3450.00
Taxable Income = $224550.00
Tax group      = Q
Tax owed       = $ 50000.00
